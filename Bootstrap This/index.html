      <h1>About Bootstrap</h1>
      <h2>open source</h2>
      <p>Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.</p>
      <h3>Mobile First</h3>
      <p>Bootstrap includes a powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, five default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.</p>
      <h4>Components Library</h4>
<p>Bootstrap comes with an extensive components library that includes buttons and lists to carousels and modals. Components are easy to integrate into any site and require no knowledge of JavaScript to use.</p>
<h5>Components</h5>
<p>Bootstrap comes with nearly two dozen components that are ready to use right out of the box.</p>
<h6>Alerts</h6> 
<p>Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the handful of available and flexible alert messages.</p>
<h8>Breadcrumbs</h8>
<p>Indicate the current page’s location within a navigational hierarchy that automatically adds separators via CSS.</p>
<h9>List group</h9>
<p>List groups are a flexible and powerful component for displaying a series of content.</p>


<h10>Spacing</h10>
<p>Bootstrap includes a wide range of shorthand responsive margin and padding utility classes to modify an element’s appearance.</p>
<h11>How it works</h11>
<p>Assign responsive-friendly margin or padding values to an element or a subset of its sides with shorthand classes. Includes support for individual properties, all properties, and vertical and horizontal properties. Classes are built from a default Sass map ranging from .25rem to 3rem.</p>
<h12>Notation</h12>
<p>Spacing utilities that apply to all breakpoints, from xs to xl, have no breakpoint abbreviation in them. This is because those classes are applied from min-width: 0 and up, and thus are not bound by a media query. The remaining breakpoints, however, do include a breakpoint abbreviation.
    The classes are named using the format {property}{sides}-{size} for xs and {property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size} for sm, md, lg, and xl.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>m - for classes that set margin</li>
        <li>p - for classes that set padding</li>
    </ul>
